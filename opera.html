        <h3>ACT-2 SCENE—Quarter-deck of H.M.S. Pinafore. Sailors, led by BOATSWAIN,
            discovered cleaning brasswork, splicing rope, etc.</h3>
            <p>Enter DICK DEADEYE. He pushes through sailors, and comes down

                DICK. I have thought it often. (All recoil from him.)
                BUT. Yes, you look like it! What's the matter with the man?
              Isn't he
              well?
                BOAT. Don't take no heed of him; that's only poor Dick Deadeye.
                DICK. I say—it's a beast of a name, ain't it—Dick Deadeye?
                BUT. It's not a nice name.
                DICK. I'm ugly too, ain't I?
                BUT. You are certainly plain.
                DICK. And I'm three-cornered too, ain't I?
                BUT. You are rather triangular.
                DICK. Ha! ha! That's it. I'm ugly, and they hate me for it; for
              you all
              hate me, don't you?
                ALL. We do!
                DICK. There!
                BOAT. Well, Dick, we wouldn't go for to hurt any fellow
              creature's
              feelings, but you can't expect a chap with such a name as Dick
              Deadeye to
              be a popular character—now can you?
                DICK. No.
                BOAT. It's asking too much, ain't it?
                DICK. It is. From such a face and form as mine the noblest
              sentiments
              sound like the black utterances of a depraved imagination It is
              human
              nature—I am resigned.</p>
