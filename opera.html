              A maiden fair to see,
                        The pearl of minstrelsy,
                          A bud of blushing beauty;
                        For whom proud nobles sigh,
                        And with each other vie
                          To do her menial's duty.
    ALL.                  To do her menial's duty.

                        A suitor, lowly born,
                        With hopeless passion torn,
                          And poor beyond denying,
                        Has dared for her to pine
                        At whose exalted shrine
                          A world of wealth is sighing.
    ALL.                  A world of wealth is sighing.

                        Unlearned he in aught
                        Save that which love has taught
                          (For love had been his tutor);
                        Oh, pity, pity me—
                        Our captain's daughter she,
                          And I that lowly suitor!

            <p class="speech">  I know the value of a kindly chorus,
              But choruses yield little consolation
                When we have pain and sorrow too before us!
                I love—and love, alas, above my station!</p>
