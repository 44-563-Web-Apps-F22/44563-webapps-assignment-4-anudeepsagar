            <p class="speech"> Ah, my poor lad, you've climbed too high: our worthy
        captain's
        child won't have nothin' to say to a poor chap like you. Will
        she, lads?</p>
          ALL. No, no.</h6>

          <p class="speech">No, no, captains' daughters don't marry foremast hands.
          ALL (recoiling from him). Shame! shame!

            <p class="speech">Dick Deadeye, them sentiments o' yourn are a disgrace to

        common natur'.</p>
        <h6 class="dic">DIC.</h6> 
        <p class="speech"> But it's a strange anomaly, that the daughter of a man
        who hails
        from the quarter-deck may not love another who lays out on the
        fore-yard
        arm. For a man is but a man, whether he hoists his flag at the
        main-truck
        or his slacks on the main-deck.</p>
        <h6 class="dic">DIC.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Ah, it's a queer world!
          RALPH. Dick Deadeye, I have no desire to press hardly on you,
        but such
        a revolutionary sentiment is enough to make an honest sailor
        shudder.
          BOAT. My lads, our gallant captain has come on deck; let us
        greet him
        as so brave an officer and so gallant a seaman deserves.</p>

          CAPT.             My gallant crew, good morning.
          ALL (saluting).        Sir, good morning!
          CAPT.             I hope you're all quite well.
          ALL(as before).        Quite well; and you, sir?
          CAPT.             I am in reasonable health, and happy
                            To meet you all once more.
          ALL (as before).       You do us proud, sir!</p>
